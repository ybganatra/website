title: Oil Price Prediction
---

This project employed machine learning techniques using
financial and economic data to attempt to predict
crude oil prices. Prediction of up/down prices movements
was attempted using both linear classifiers (SVM,
Logistic Classification) and non-linear classifiers (Decision
Trees). Price prediction was attempted using
Quadratic and Huber loss models with regularization
and non-linear ensemble methods such as Random
Forest, Boosting and Stacking. Finally, a modified
ensemble method was proposed and executed, which
delivered promising results.
