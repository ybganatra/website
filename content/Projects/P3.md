title: Regime Detection
---

This project was our entry for the International Association of Quantitative Finance (IAQF's) annual academic competition. The goal of the research is to predict the market regimes (Bull, Bear or Static) using mathematical and machine learning techniques. 

We used the Hidden Markov Model as our base engine to identify the hidden states of historical markets based on the value of the Russell 3000 index, and used other macroeconomical indicators like the VIX index to capture signals. We trained our model to combine the different signals to predict future market states based on the index price.
