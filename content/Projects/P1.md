title: Portfolio Optimization
---

This project is based on Index Tracking Portfolio Optimization, wherein I used the Nifty50 Index as a benchmark to build optimal portfolios using the Markowitz Mean-Variance Model in python, and constructed portfolios with mean excess returns over Nifty50 of 0.05% and 0.02% by maximizing Sharpe and minimizing Risk.
