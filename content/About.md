title: About me
---

Hi! I am Yash Ganatra, a Master of Engineering in Financial Engineering student at Cornell. I was a quantitative risk analyst at Nomura specializing in risk on financing trades from July 2019 to June 2021. I did my undergraduate from BITS Pilani Goa, India, where I did a double major in Mathematics (M.Sc.) and Mechanical Engineering (B.E.). I'm curious about the applications of mathematical modelling in quantitative research.

This is where I plan to write about my journey through the world of quantitative finance, and about my research and projects at Cornell.

You can reach me via email at ybganatra2@gmail.com or ybg3@cornell.edu.
